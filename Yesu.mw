threw a wish in the well
 Don't ask me I'll never tell
 I looked at you as it fell
 And now you're in my way

I trade my soul for a wish
 Pennies and dimes for a kiss
 I wasn't looking for this
 But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
 Ripped jeans
 Skin was showing
 Hot night
 Wind was blowing
 Where you think you're going baby?

Hey I just met you
 And this is crazy
 But here's my number
 So call me maybe
 It's hard to look right at you baby
 But here's my number
 So call me maybe

Hey I just met you
 And this is crazy
 But here's my number
 So call me maybe
 And all the other boys
 Try to chase me
 But here's my number
 So call me maybe

You took your time with the call
 I took no time with the fall
 You gave me nothing at all
 But still you're in my way

I beg and borrow and steal
 At first sight and it's real
 I didn't know I would feel it
 But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
 Ripped jeans
 Skin was showing
 Hot night
 Wind was blowing
 Where you think you're going baby?

Hey I just met you
 And this is crazy
 But here's my number
